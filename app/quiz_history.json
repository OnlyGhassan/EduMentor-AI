        "feedback": "Feedback: Your answer is incorrect. The correct syntax to start a while loop in Python is \"while x > 6:\". The colon at the end is necessary to indicate the start of the block of statements that the loop will execute."

        "result": "Incorrect \u274c",
        "feedback": "Feedback: Your answer is incorrect. In Python, functions are defined using the \"def\" keyword followed by the function name and parentheses. The correct syntax is \"def functionName():\". Therefore, the correct answer is A) def functionName():."

        "feedback": "Feedback: Your answer is correct. In Python, the type() function is used to know which class a variable or a value belongs to. The correct syntax is type(object). So, to print the type of a variable, you should use print(type(variable))."
